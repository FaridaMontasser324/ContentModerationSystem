🛡️ Content Moderation System

📌 Project Overview

The Content Moderation System automatically classifies and filters user-generated content using machine learning techniques.
It simulates real-world content moderation platforms used by major companies like OpenAI, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.

This system demonstrates how rule-based filters and ML models can work together to identify:

🔴 Toxic content

🟡 Spam content

🟢 Safe content

🏗️ System Architecture

1️⃣ Text Preprocessing Module

✨ Text normalization and cleaning

📊 Feature extraction (length, word count, capitalization ratio, etc.)

🔗 URL, mention, and hashtag detection

2️⃣ Rule-Based Filter

🚫 Keyword blacklists for offensive or banned terms

🔍 Pattern matching for suspicious promotional content

⚠️ Excessive capitalization and character repetition detection

3️⃣ Machine Learning Classifier

🧠 Algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest

📝 TF-IDF vectorization for text representation

🔹 Multi-class classification: toxic, spam, safe

4️⃣ Risk Assessment Engine

⚖️ Weighted scoring combining rule-based and ML predictions

🔧 Configurable confidence thresholds

🔄 Dynamic decision making based on risk scores

🌟 Key Features

✅ Automatic classification of user-generated content

🤖 Combination of rule-based filtering and ML models

🎯 Multi-class prediction: toxic, spam, safe

🔒 Configurable risk thresholds for safer moderation
